## Objective
The Peer Assessment Application project will help our team gain hands-on experience with software development using Agile methodology. Our project will follow an Agile Scrum approach, with four sprints focusing on incremental development, collaboration and continuous improvement. Important skills will be developed from this project such as project management, teamwork, and software development practices.  
## Project Description
The Peer Assessment System is a web application designed for university group projects, enabling students to assess their teammates' contributions across four essential areas: cooperation, conceptual input, practical work, and work ethic. By providing constructive feedback, this system fosters accountability and enhances team collaboration while supporting individual growth. The system is designed for two key user groups: students and instructors, each benefiting from features that encourage transparent and efficient peer evaluations.
